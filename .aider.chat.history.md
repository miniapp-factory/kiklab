#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Internet laboratory environment where medical diseases are accurately diagnosis   
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are:

1. **Create a new file** `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` that contains the image size and a detailed description of the logo you want to generate.

2. **Edit the existing file** `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to update the `title` and `description` values to match the new app description.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for that file. Once you add it, I’ll give you the blocks for both the new file and the edits to `metadata.ts`.

A stylized logo for an internet laboratory environment where medical diseases are accurately diagnosed. The logo features a clean, modern design with a stylized microscope icon integrated into a digital network grid, using a palette of blue and green hues to convey trust and innovation. The background is a subtle gradient from light blue to white, and the microscope is centered with a subtle glow effect. The overall shape is circular with a slight shadow to give depth.
